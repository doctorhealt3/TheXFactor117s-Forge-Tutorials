# TheXFactor117s-Forge-Tutorials
Hello! I assume you are here to start learning how to mod Minecraft, or to further your knowledge in Minecraft and Forge. Either way, you have come to the right place. Making mods can be a very complicated process, or an extremely simple process. Whether you want to make a new item or block, or wish to create the next “big” mod, these tutorials, and myself, will try and help you reach your goal!

Anyways, there are a few things I’d like to go over first:
* Don’t expect your first mod to be a huge hit, amassing thousands of downloads. In fact, don’t expect to get more than 20 during the first month. Rather then thinking about creating a successful mod, take the approach of “I’m going to learn how to mod, so I can make a better mod”.
* Programming mods is a long and tedious process. You’ll get errors. You’ll find bugs. You may rage a few times. But don’t let this discourage you - finding a fix to a bug in your code is an amazing feeling of accomplishment!
* You do not need existing programming knowledge to make a mod. Despite what people say, it is not a requirement, but rather a very helpful boost. Now, I would highly recommend you go out and get comfortable with the basics of Java first, or you may get a few headaches at what some keyword means.
* Do not come into modding thinking about making money. It doesn’t work that way - trust me. In total, over my 2 and a half years, I’ve made $20.
* If your first mod fails, try again. Then again. And again. You’ll learn a tremendous amount of information along the way to help create a successful mod.

It would also be good to go over my intentions for these tutorials as well (this is the order as well).
* Be able to make basic items, blocks, weapons, and armor.
* Be able to generate ores throughout your world.
* Be able to make shaped, shapeless, and smelting recipes, along with removing vanilla recipes, and adding new ones.
* Be able to make simple passive and aggressive mobs.
* Be able to make new entity projectiles (arrows, etc.)
* Be able to make complex items, blocks, weapons, and armor.
* Be able to generate custom structures throughout your world.
* Be able to make complex hostile and boss mobs.
* Have a suggestion for something to go over? Let me know!

Before we get started, there are a few things you should know after you’ve gotten everything setup. 

You will come across errors, and you will most likely not know what to do. There are multiple kinds of errors you can get, but you can generally categorize them as simple fixes, and errors that require manual work. Simple errors are such as missing imports, a missing parameter, or missing a keyword. These are easy fixes, and you should become familiar with how to fix them, as no one really likes answering simple questions (although those who offer help on my thread, and myself, should be ready to help you anyways!). The other kind of errors are harder to either identify, or throw a strange error at you. If you encounter one of these, please, please post on my thread using the following format. It makes it so much harder if you don’t, and you may not get answered!

* Description of your problem, and what you are trying to do.
* Included class files posted to either gist or pastebin.
* Crash Report if needed posted to either gist or pastebin.

If you follow this format, you will most likely get an answer to your problem fairly quickly, as we have the information needed to help you out in front of us.
